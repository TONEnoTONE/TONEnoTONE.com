		<div id="whatis" class="Question">
			What is Echo?
		</div>
		<div class="Answer">
			As the name suggests, Echo is a musical game. Each of the levels is an original song 
			which you can unlocked part by part. If you get 3 stars on a level, you can REMIX 
			that track and hear it together with the rest of the song. 
		</div>


		<div id='cantrotate' class="Question">
			I can't rotate the pieces.
		</div>
		<div class="Answer">This is a novel technique and we 
			realize that it can be difficult at first. Though once you 
			get used to it, it's quite fast. 
			<br>
			<br>
			To rotate a piece double tap on it when it's on the board. 
			1. 2. If you keep your finger down on the second tap, you'll see a circle
			with arrows appear over the piece. Now you can drag your finger in any of the
			four directions indicated by the arrows. North. South. East. West. 
			Keep your finger down and you can keep dragging to test out a few directions.

		<div id='fifthlevel' class="Question">
			I'm stuck on the fifth level!
		</div>
		<div class="Answer">
			A lot of people get stuck here. The solution is to place the pink piece on the top row
			and the orange piece on the bottom.
			<br> 
			<img id='LevelFive' src='./images/level5.png'/>
			<br>
			You'll notice that the top row is only 2 squares wide
			and the bottom row is 4 squares wide. This gives the pink piece a 2 beat loop which in tern
			makes it hit twice in the duration of 4 beats. 
		</div>


		<div id='patternhints' class="Question">
			Do the pattern hints ever turn off?
		</div>
		<div class="Answer">
			After the 6th level, hints turn off and each level takes much more attention to detail. 
		</div>

		
		<div id='playonline' class="Question">
			Can I still play online?
		</div>
		<div class="Answer">
			Yes. You can still play <a target='blank' href='http://tonenotone.com/ECHO/'>Echo online</a>. 
			But for the best mobile experience, get the app.
